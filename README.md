# titanic
reads the titanic dataset and trains the RandomForestClassifier model

NOTE:
 I've uploaded both titanic.csv and titanic.xlsx (although I've used only titanic.xlsx). You can use any of them. Just make sure to modify line 1 of cell 2 in titanic.ipynb to "pd.read_csv(r'/path/to/titanic.csv')"
